/**
 * A snapshot is like a picture of an entity at a given point in time. And guess what is
 * one of the simplest way for testing React components. With snapshot testing you can take a picture of a
 * React component and then compare the original against another snapshot later on.
 * Snapshot testing is a feature built into the Jest test runner and since itâ€™s the default library for testing React
